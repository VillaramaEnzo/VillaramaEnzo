### Welcome to my profile, 
# I'm Enzo
### Building digital experiences that balance function and aesthetic. 
I’m a multidisciplinary creative with a background in design, front-end development, and IT/data operations. I enjoy exploring the space where logic meets expression — crafting interfaces, tools, and workflows that not only work well but feel intentional and visually engaging.
I’m continually learning, experimenting, and refining my approach, whether through web development, digital design, or systems thinking. 

My work is driven by curiosity, clarity, and the pursuit of building things that feel both meaningful and useful.
